      <p> The DP-Library provides this website as a public service. This Privacy Policy
        explains the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data by The
        DP-Library in relation to your use of the website
        dplibrary.deepmd.org (“Website”). When we use the term “personal data” in

        or other unique identifier. </p>

      <h3>Collection of personal data</h3>
      <p> When you register, we will collect
        information about your affiliation. This helps us to obtain funding and
        target our tools to the needs of our users. We also collect an email address
        that we will use to identify your profile. This allows you to review
        previous work and control sharing of permalinks. When you use the Dp-Library
        Website, our servers will automatically collect the following
        information: your IP address (which may be used to indicate your general
        location), your browser type and version, date and time of the visit, and
        the pages that you view on dplibrary.deepmd.org. Additionally we also
        monitor and log all activity on the site, including any searches generated
        by you. By default all user-generated data will not be visible to the public
        unless the user explicitly designates them to be so. </p>


      <h3>Use of personal data</h3>
      <p> We use the personal data we collect for
        internal purposes only - for example, to help us measure the number of
